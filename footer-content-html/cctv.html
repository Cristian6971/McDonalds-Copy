            <p>The Company may update or modify this policy, in which case we will inform you by publishing the new version on the Company's website, <a href="https://www.mcdonalds.ro" class="link">https://www.mcdonalds.ro</a> ("the Site"). The updated (or modified) policy will take effect and begin to be enforceable from the date it is published on the Site.</p>

            <p>If you have any questions regarding this IP-CCTV Privacy Policy, you can contact us by email at <a href="mailto:gdpr@ro.mcd.com" class="link">gdpr@ro.mcd.com</a> or by mail or courier at the address in Bucharest, Nicolae Titulescu Blvd no. 4-8, America House Building, West Wing, 5th Floor, Sector 1.</p>

            <h2>General Information about the IP-CCTV System</h2>
            <p>The Company operates a closed-circuit television (CCTV) system – IP-CCTV, exclusively to ensure the safety and security of people and property, to prevent, discourage, and manage security incidents, and to prevent criminal activities. This system is part of the measures supporting the Company's security policies.</p>
            <p>The IP-CCTV system is a conventional system. All surveillance cameras operate 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.</p>
            <p>The IP-CCTV system monitors the minimum necessary areas to ensure the safety and security of people and property at the Company's locations.</p>
            <p>There are no surveillance cameras in areas that provide a higher degree of privacy (such as, for example, employee changing rooms or restrooms).</p>

            <h2>Personal Data Processed by the IP-CCTV System</h2>
            <p>If you visit the Company's headquarters or our restaurants and cafes (inside buildings such as shopping malls or on terraces), we may process your image captured by the IP-CCTV system.</p>

            <h2>Purposes and Legal Grounds of Processing</h2>
            <p>We process your image captured by the IP-CCTV system exclusively for the purpose of ensuring safety and security, guarding and protecting people and property. We process this data based on our legitimate interest (Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR) or to comply with legal provisions regarding the protection of premises, goods, valuables, and personal protection (Art. 6 (1) (b) GDPR).</p>

            <h2>Data Retention</h2>
            <p>We retain the images captured by the IP-CCTV system for a minimum of 20 days, and a maximum of 30 days from the time they were captured. However, if the images are used in an investigation of incidents, we may keep them until the investigation is completed.</p>

            <h2>Transfer of Data Captured by the IP-CCTV System</h2>
            <p>The Company is committed to protecting your image captured by the IP-CCTV system. For the purposes of data processing, the Company may transfer such data to the following categories of recipients:</p>

                <li>Contractual partners of the Company, specializing in providing services related to the operation, technical support, and maintenance of the IP-CCTV system. The Company carefully selects these providers and ensures they only process your personal data according to the Company's instructions and only for the purpose of providing the contracted services;</li>
                <li>Other companies within the group of which the Company is a part;</li>
                <li>Public authorities, in response to their requests for information or to protect the rights, assets, or safety of the Company;</li>

            </ul>
            <p>No routine or periodic transfers occur.</p>
