        <!-- The Ray Kroc Story -->
        <div class="details">
            <h2>The Ray Kroc Story</h2>
            <p class="italic">"If I had received a brick for every time I repeated the words: Quality, Service,
                Cleanliness and Value, I think I could now build a bridge across the Atlantic Ocean with them."</p>
            <p>– Ray Kroc</p>
        </div>


        <!-- early -->
        <div class="details">
            <h2>early</h2>
            <p class="padding-p">"How does one create an overnight restaurant empire at the age of 52? As Ray Kroc said:
                "It was an overnight success, but 30 years is a long, long night."</p>
            <p class="padding-p">In 1917, at 15, Ray Kroc did not reveal his real age to join the Red Cross as an
                ambulance driver, but the war ended before he could complete his apprenticeship. He then worked as a
                pianist, a paper cup salesman and a sales agent for multifunction mixers.</p>
            <p class="padding-p">In 1954, he received an order for eight multipurpose mixers from a restaurant in San
                Bernardino, California. Here, Ray Kroc found a small but successful restaurant run by brothers Dick and
                Mac McDonald and was amazed at how it worked. The restaurant had a limited menu of burgers, fries and
                drinks. This allowed them to focus more on the quality of the products served.</p>
            <p class="padding-p">Kroc proposed to the McDonald brothers to expand their business nationally. In 1955, he
                founded the McDonald's® Corporation, and five years later bought exclusive rights to the McDonald's
                name. By 1958, McDonald's® had already sold over 100 million hamburgers.</p>
            <p class="padding-p">Ray Kroc's unique philosophy was to build a chain of restaurants that was renowned for
                high quality food products and uniform methods of preparation. He wanted to offer burgers, fries, buns
                and drinks that would taste the same in Alaska and Alabama.</p>
        </div>


        <!-- "In business for you, but not alone" -->
        <div class="details">
            <h2 class="italic">"In business for you, but not alone"</h2>
            <p class="padding-p">To achieve this, Kroc chose to follow a unique path: to convince franchise owners and
                suppliers to buy into his vision, but not to work for McDonald's®, but for themselves, together with
                McDonald's®. He promoted the slogan: "in business for you, but not alone." His business philosophy was
                based on the principle of business partnership between McDonald's®, franchise owners and McDonald's®
                suppliers. The innovative Ray Kroc believed in the entrepreneurial spirit and rewarded his franchise
                owners for individual creativity. Many of McDonald's® famous products such as the Big Mac®,
                Filet-O-Fish® and Egg McMuffin® were created by them. At the same time, the operating system created by
                McDonald's® urged franchise owners to follow the basic principles of McDonald's®: quality, service,
                cleanliness and value.</p>
            <p>The basis of the quality of the products lies in the fact that each ingredient has been tested, tasted
                and improved to suit the system. With the growth of the company, the massive volume of orders attracted
                the attention of suppliers, and McDonald's® standards became their standards as well. In the same way,
                other quick service restaurants have taken up the high standards of McDonald's®, producing an
                improvement in the meat and dairy industry. Again, Ray Kroc sought a partnership, but this time with
                McDonald's® suppliers, succeeding in creating the most integrated, innovative and efficient supply
                system in the food field. These relationships have grown, with many of today's suppliers entering the
                business with Ray Kroc's handshake.</p>

         <!-- University of Hamburg -->
         <div class="details">
            <h2>University of Hamburg</h2>
            <p>In 1961, Ray Kroc launched a training program later named Hamburger University at a new restaurant in Elk Grove Village, Illinois. There, franchise owners and operators were trained through scientific methods on how to run a successful McDonald's® restaurant. Hamburger University also had a research and development laboratory to create new methods of cooking, freezing, storing and serving. Today, more than 80,000 people have graduated from Hamburger University courses.</p>
